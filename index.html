            <li><strong>Geolocation Information.</strong> We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our mobile application(s), to provide certain location-based services.

            <li><strong>Push Notifications.</strong> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>

        <h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

        <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</h3>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="section5">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

        <h2 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact us at <strong>appusai585@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions (such as the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

        <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure, (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information, (iv) if applicable, to data portability, and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.</p>

        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <strong>Member State data protection authority</strong> or <strong>UK data protection authority</strong>. If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <strong>Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Withdrawing your consent</h3>
        <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information (which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</p>

        <p>However, this will not affect the lawfulness of processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

        <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <strong>appusai585@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

        <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

        <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

        <h2 id="section10">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> If you are a resident of <strong>California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia</strong>, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law.</p>

        <p>The table below shows the categories of personal information we have collected in the past twelve (12) months. The table includes illustrative examples of each category and does not reflect the personal information we collect from you.</p>
